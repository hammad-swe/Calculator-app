SwiftUI Calculator
Overview
This repository contains the source code for a modern calculator app built with SwiftUI, Apple's declarative UI framework. Inspired by the classic iOS calculator, this app provides a clean, responsive user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

The app is designed to be a learning tool for SwiftUI, showcasing key concepts such as:

State Management: Using @State to manage the app's dynamic display and logic.

Reusable Components: Building modular views like CalculatorButtonRow to create a clean and scalable UI.

Custom Modifiers: Applying modifiers to create a custom look and feel, including rounded buttons and custom colors.

Responsive Layout: Arranging views using HStack and VStack to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

Features
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Responsive UI: The layout automatically adjusts to different iPhone screen sizes.

Customizable Appearance: Easily change button colors and styles.
